# Attendance Calculator

I was tired of manually calculating it. Why do something thing the **normal way** which takes **10 minutes** when you can **automate it** which takes **4 hours** .
It uses a simple formula to find the attendance percentage. 

## Features

- Calculate the attendance required to reach the desired percentage (by attending or by bunking).

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vedabahu/attendenceCalculator.git
cd attendenceCalculator
npm i
npm run dev # starts the vite server
```
